# IrisAxisRotationClamp
> Represents a rotation axis with intervals and maxes
```json
{
    "min": 0,
    "max": 0,
    "interval": 0,
    "enabled": false
}
```

## enabled
> Should this axis be rotated at all?

## min
> The minimum angle (from) or set this and max to zero for any angle degrees

## max
> The maximum angle (to) or set this and min to zero for any angle degrees

## interval
